Preconditions are classes that will determine whether or not a command should be ran according to certain conditions.
Sapphire has many built in preconditions ready for use that are outlined in the coming pages, such as for [creating\\
cooldowns](https://sapphirejs.dev/docs/Guide/preconditions/command-cooldown), [restricting channel types](https://sapphirejs.dev/docs/Guide/preconditions/channel-types), [handling\\
permissions](https://sapphirejs.dev/docs/Guide/preconditions/handling-permissions), and [filtering nsfw channels](https://sapphirejs.dev/docs/Guide/preconditions/nsfw-filter). However, we also provide an easy system
for you to create your own preconditions, which you can learn how to use on the next page.
